# listy-vue-starter-code

## Overview

I hope to post a repository with the completed project and a link to the posted YouTube video soon! 

This starter-code is truly bare-bones: basically I started recording the video and realized that creating css styling on the fly takes a long time and is not super exciting... so I stopped, produced this template, and re-recorded! 

All of the logic including the addition of any dependencies is / will be available through the repository of the completed version of the app (to be posted) or through the video (also to be posted!). 

Hopefully I will remember to update this readme at that point!
